# ZicPlay

> [!WARNING]
> Following Microsoft's decision to merge GitHub into its AI division in the summer of 2025 and therefore to consider what we publish on it only as a source of training for its models without any compensation (apart from hosting the source codes) or to bombard us with their injunctions to use Copilot everywhere, for everything and anything, I have decided to stop maintaining the repositories here.

> Maintenance of this project has been moved to Codeberg at https://codeberg.org/PatrickPremartin/Zicplay

> Codeberg is a community-based hosting service located in Europe that respects developers, the license of each project, and the privacy of those who connect to it.

ZicPlay is a music player for desktops, smartphones and tablets. It plays sound files in MP3 and M4A formats (if supported by your device).

The program is based on a system of playlists created from various sources and your selection criteria.

ZicPlay is a FireMonkey project developed in Delphi. It makes maximum use of the features provided by default in recent versions of Delphi and RAD Studio. A third-party library can be used to retrieve information on the tracks in your catalog, and is listed with others in the “dependencies” section below.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Using this software

Visit [the Zicplay website](https://zicplay.olfsoftware.fr) to download the compiled version, learn more about how it works, access videos and articles, find out about the different versions available and their features, contact user support...

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Zicplay).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/Audio-Tools-Library](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Audio-Tools-Library) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/Audio-Tools-Library subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMXExtend-Library](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMXExtend-Library) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/Delphi-FMXExtend-Library subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-Game-Engine) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/Delphi-Game-Engine subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/FMX-Tools-Starter-Kit subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/librairies subfolder.

## Documentation and support

I use comments in [XMLDOC](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/XML_Documentation_Comments) format in Delphi to document my projects. They are recognized by Help Insight, which offers real-time input help in the code editor.

I regularly use the [DocInsight](https://devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/) tool to enter them and check their formatting.

Documentation is exported in HTML by [DocInsight](https://devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/) or [PasDoc](https://pasdoc.github.io) to the /docs folder of the repository. You can also [access it online](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/Zicplay) through the hosting offered by GitHub Pages.

Further information (tutorials, articles, videos, FAQ, talks and links) can be found on [the project website](https://zicplay.olfsoftware.fr) or [the project devlog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/zicplay.html).

If you need explanations or help in understanding or using parts of this project in yours, please [contact me](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/nous-contacter.php). I can either direct you to an online resource, or offer you assistance in the form of a paid or free service, depending on the case. You can also contact me at a conference or during an online presentation.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Zicplay/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
